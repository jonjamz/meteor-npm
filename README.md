meteor-npm
=================

Written in CoffeeScript, this file helps you easily import NPM modules into a Meteor project by providing some example code for both Node and NPM requires.

It requires the [NPM Meteor package from Atmosphere](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/npm)

It should be placed in the /server folder of your Meteor project..
